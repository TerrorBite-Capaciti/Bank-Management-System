The Bank Management System is a Java and React-based application that helps manage bank accounts effectively. Built with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP), it offers functionalities like deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers, while ensuring robustness through exception handling for scenarios such as overdrafts and invalid transactions.
