## 📚 Overview

The Bank Management System is a console-based application that helps manage bank accounts effectively. Built with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP), it offers functionalities like deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers, while ensuring robustness through exception handling for scenarios such as overdrafts and invalid transactions.

  - Display account details.

Transactions
  - Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money securely.
  - Automatically handle overdraft prevention and transaction validation.

Object-Oriented Design
  - Leverage inheritance for different account types.
  - Encapsulation ensures data integrity.
